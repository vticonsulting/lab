<h2 id="whatarefams">WHAT ARE FAMs</h2>

<p>
	It takes faith, time, money, and emotion to prioritize at-risk kids and their families. We’re grateful when a church partner decides to make this investment to care for vulnerable children, and we want to do all we can to help push forward their mission. To alleviate the stress and confusion that can come with creating any new ministry, we’ve created a <strong>step-by–step model</strong> called Family Advocacy Ministries (FAMs).
</p>

<h2 id="whyfams">WHY FAMs?</h2>

<p>
	Churches are often full of people who want to make a positive impact in the lives of vulnerable children, but don’t always know how. We believe if churches are empowered to openly and effectively share about the problems at-risk children are experiencing, families will step up, either by becoming a foster or adoptive family or by deciding to support a family in crisis. They simply need a plan.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Promise686 implements FAMs to help bring about a positive impact in the lives of vulnerable children by:</strong>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Recruiting &amp; Equipping families to care for at-risk kids</li>
	<li>Serving foster &amp; adoptive families, and biological families in crisis</li>
	<li>Advocating on behalf of families and vulnerable children</li>
	<li>Ministering to families and meeting physical, emotional, and spiritual needs</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<strong>Promise provides the training, resources, and guidance needed to empower churches to set up and maintain successful FAMs.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>START SMALL OR GO ALL OUT:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	We believe every church can do <em>something</em> to make a difference in the child welfare crisis. Depending on your church’s area of interests, resources available, and families in need, <strong>your</strong> something could look like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Praying diligently and consistently</li>
	<li>Raising awareness around the needs of vulnerable children</li>
	<li>Recruiting families to consider adoption and fostering</li>
	<li>Serving foster &amp; adoptive families, and biological families in crisis through Care Communities</li>
	<li>Meeting physical and financial needs</li>
	<li>Providing adoption grants &amp; resources to the families in your congregation</li>
	<li>Ministering to families and meeting emotional and spiritual needs</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Every FAM may look different but they all have one thing in common: needs are met and lives are changed. The list above shows a few ways to engage, but simply fill out the form to get started with <em>something</em>. Nothing is too small!

<p>
	<strong>CHURCH ADVOCATES + CLINICS</strong>
</p>

<p>Every Family Advocacy Ministry (FAM) needs leaders to create awareness, equip volunteers, and spark action. We call these leaders <strong>Church Advocates</strong>. All Advocates are trained at a one-day Clinic where they receive everything needed to create and maintain a successful FAM within their local church. In addition to the Clinic, Promise686 provides resources and ongoing support to Church Advocates and their volunteers. As an Advocate, we want you to be completely equipped to best serve foster &amp; adoptive families, and biological families in crisis.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>WHO TO SERVE</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Not all FAMs will serve foster, adoptive, and biological families. Many times, FAMs decide to start out with one particular area of focus, like supporting foster families or raising awareness around adoption needs. Once FAMs are a little more established, we often see them expand their reach and the types of families they serve. The one thing all FAMs have in common is that they care for vulnerable children by supporting families in need.

</p>

<p>
	<strong>WHY PARTNER WITH PROMISE686</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Promise provides the training, resources, and guidance needed to empower church leaders, ministry leaders, and volunteers to set up and maintain successful FAMs. In fact, we’ve trained nearly 600 churches in 19 states and the impact made through these church partners is significant.
</p>

<p>
	Did you know the national average of families who quit fostering within the first year is about 50%? When supported by a FAM and its Care Communities, over 90% continue fostering into a second year. Care Communities are just one way Family Advocacy Ministries bring about positive change in the child welfare crisis.
