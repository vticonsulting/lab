### The Foster Care Crisis

Every year in South Florida, 2,400 children are removed from their homes and placed in foster care.
The foster care issue is rising and in order to effectively combat the crisis, it is imperative to
go upstream with sustainable solutions focusing on root causes. 80-84% of children are being removed
from a single mother due to unmet basic needs and poverty-related issues. Single mothers are most
susceptible to loosing their children into the foster care system due to present risk factors
related to living in poverty. It is true that some children need a loving foster home that can care
for them in a way that their bio parent couldn’t, but it is also true that most children just need
someone to advocate for their mom and help her get a well-paying job.

### Mission + Vision

**Ēma exists to reduce the number of children in foster care through prevention and mother advocacy
while increasing family wellness and economic mobility.** We imagine a world where mothers are given
equal opportunity to break generational cycles of poverty and a world that is responsive to her
needs.

## Stories

The road to reunification.

Bianca and her two younger sisters experienced the sudden and traumatic loss of their mother when
she was 16 years old. They moved in with their grandmother, whose boyfriend began sexually abusing
all three girls. They were quickly removed and placed into the foster care system, where they
eventually aged out. Bianca never found stability and searched for support in men, finding herself
pregnant. Four children later, the cycle was continuing. Her children were placed in care. Without
her children, Bianca spiraled down and two years later she was served with a motion to Terminate
Parental Rights by the Court.

In Bianca’s mind, there was no hope. The four beautiful children that she brought into this world
would never know her as “mom”. That night, Bianca was invited to Ēma and assigned her first Ēma
Advocate. Her Advocate believed that with Bianca’s mind focused and heart activated, this motion for
TPR could be overturned. In six months, Bianca was working in management, in a reliable housing
program, and had grown exponentially in her parenting skills and coping mechanisms.

After months of advocacy, wrap-around services, and increased economic mobility, Bianca’s TPR was
overturned and she was reunified with all four children. When asked, “What is one word you would use
to describe Ēma?”, Bianca responded with tears streaming down her face, “Family. Ēma’s my family.
The support I’ve needed for a long, long time. My kids are home with me because of Ēma.”

## Foster Care Prevention

### We have a simple goal: to lower the number of children brought into foster care.

The number of children into foster care increases every year. 84% of children entering into foster
due to neglect, unmet basic needs, and poverty related issues. It is imperative that our culture
begins to address this crisis with an upstream approach at its root. We are a certified organization
to facilitate a trauma-informed, evidence-based curriculums. Life coaching, parental education,
career assistance, job placement, housing assistance, crisis resources, and Court advocacy are all
included within the wrap-around support needed for a vulnerable mom. We imagine a world where every
mother has equal opportunity to break generational cycles of poverty and where a community is
responsive to her needs. Society views a mother in poverty as the problem in the foster care crisis,
we see her as the solution.
