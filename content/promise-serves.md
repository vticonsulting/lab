  Why? Because children need families.

precommit_checklist:
  - Localize language -- Verify beyond Google Translate
features:
  - Dark mode
  - Continously updated developer previews
  - Automated functional testing with Cypress.io
  - Testing Library, https://testinglibrary.com, a very light-weight solution for testing without
    all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes
    similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests
    give you confidence in your UI code.
