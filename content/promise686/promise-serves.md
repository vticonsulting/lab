In 2017, we developed **Promise Serves**, a church software that alleviates the burdens many
ministry leaders face.

At **Promise686**, we equip churches to implement
[Family Advocacy Ministries](/family-advocacy-ministries) (FAMs) with the goal of caring for
vulnerable children. The FAM model, like many other ministries, requires _relationship management_,
_admin_, and _volunteer coordination_. We’ve created Promise Serves specifically to handle the
custom needs this ministry requires.

**This software keeps volunteers engaged, prevents burnout, and ultimately, provides consistent
support to families in need.**
