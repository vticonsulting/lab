## WHO WE SERVE

OUR HEART IS FOR VULNERABLE CHILDREN

When there are 140 million considered orphans worldwide, with over 400,000 of these children living
in the United States, we know there’s work to be done. We partner with churches across the nation to
provide what vulnerable children need most–**strong families**.

God promises to “set the lonely in families” (Psalm 68:6) and we’re dedicated to joining this
effort.

## WHAT WE DO

OUR MISSION IS TO MOBILIZE CHURCH COMMUNITIES TO CARE FOR VULNERABLE CHILDREN

We carry out this mission by equipping churches to support local foster & adoptive families, and
biological families in crisis. By training churches on how to create and lead successful
[Family Advocacy Ministries (FAMs)](/fams), we’re working toward seeing every child in a safe and
loving family, forever.

## WHAT ARE FAMILY ADVOCACY MINISTRIES (FAMs)?

It takes time, money, and emotion to prioritize at-risk kids and their families. We’re grateful when
a church partner decides to make this investment to care for vulnerable children in their local
community, and we want to do all we can to help push forward their mission. To alleviate the stress
and confusion that can come with creating any new ministry, we’ve created **a step-by–step model
called Family Advocacy Ministries (FAMs)**.

Promise686 implements FAMs to help bring about a positive impact in the lives of vulnerable children
by:

- Praying diligently and consistently
- Raising awareness around the needs of vulnerable children
- Recruiting & equipping families to care for at-risk kids
- Serving families in crisis through Care Communities
- Meeting physical and financial needs
- Advocating on behalf of families and vulnerable children
- Providing adoption grants & resources to the families in your congregation
- Ministering to families to help meet emotional and spiritual needs

Every FAM may look different but they all have one thing in common: needs are met and lives are
changed.

**Promise provides the training, resources, and guidance needed to empower churches to set up and
maintain successful FAMs.**

_**Interesting fact about FAMs:** The national average of families who continue fostering after
their first year is about 50%, but when supported by a FAM and its
[care communities](/care-communities), 90% continue fostering into a second year._

## OUR STRATEGY BOILS DOWN TO THREE STEPS

**PREVENT at-risk children from entering foster care by supporting biological families in crisis.**

In many cases, an at-risk child already lives with a loving, biological family, but that family
isn’t equipped to fully care for their child in that season. Sometimes a house payment or grocery
bill could mean the difference between a child staying with family or entering foster care.
Churches, when aware and educated, have the opportunity to support a biological family in crisis and
help keep that family together.

**INTERVENE in a child’s life when the state intervenes in a child’s life.**

When neglect or abuse is involved, the state will intervene. This means it’s time for the Church to
intervene. Promise686 and our church partners are not equipped to determine whether a family is a
good fit for fostering or adoption. That’s up to the state. What we can and should do, however, is
come around our local foster and adoptive families to provide a support system.

**CONNECT children to families, forever.**

We provide adoption grants and resources to help families understand the adoption process, learn how
to care for adopted children, create a healthy, loving environment for their kids, and bring
vulnerable children home.

## Our goal is to see every child in a safe and loving family, forever.

We’re excited to announce our FAM model, powered by our three-step strategy, has now grown to 504
churches and 24 affiliates in 18 states. This nationwide partnership is known as The Promise
Network. We are incredibly grateful for the churches and nonprofit affiliates who partner with us to
work toward this goal.
