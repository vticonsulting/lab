Use the one(s) that best suits you needs

#### Traceable Files

Encode and watermark your files using our file encoder. Encoded files can then be uploaded to any
other site. Our automated bots will send DMCA takedowns if they find these encoded signatures
anywhere on the web. You also have the option of copying a "Secure Share Link" to your file. This
link can be safely shared anywhere and has the added benefit of detecting the person that stole your
content.

#### DMCA Takedowns: You can submit any URL for us to perform DMCA takedowns on your behalf.

#### Copyright Bounty Program

the web. This is suggested for anyone who creates live streaming content.

using DMCA.
