This is my personal list of books that I recommend to read if you are a software developer. Most of
these books are technology agnostic so feel free to choose any to start reading.

- [Clean Code]
- [The Art Of Redable Code]
- [Refactoring: Improving the Desing of Existing Code]
- [Don't Make Me Think] (UI/UX)
- [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know]()
- [Clean Code JavaScript] (JavaScript)
- [Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual]
