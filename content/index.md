lead:
  Our hope is to see every child in a safe, loving family, forever, and we carry out this mission by

  Why? Because children need families.

copy_inspiration:
  - Atlassian's no-nonsense guide to agile development
  - Beautiful UI components, crafted by the creators of Tailwind CSS
  - Fully responsive HTML components, designed and developed by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger
precommit_checklist:
  - Localize language -- Verify beyond Google Translate
features:
  - Dark mode
  - Continously updated developer previews
  - Automated functional testing with Cypress.io
  - Testing Library, https://testinglibrary.com, a very light-weight solution for testing without
    all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes
    similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests
    give you confidence in your UI code.
